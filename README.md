Home server / private cloud (NetBird + Docker)


# Secure Private Cloud Homelab

## Overview
Designed and implemented a secure private cloud environment connecting
multiple devices (Windows, Linux, Android) and containerized services
using NetBird and Docker.

## Architecture
- Arch Linux machine as primary host
- Windows 11 and Android as client devices
- Docker container hosting internal applications
- NetBird used as a secure overlay network for private access

## Key Features
- No public port exposure
- Device-to-device secure connectivity
- Containerized internal services
- Cross-platform access

## What I Worked On
- Network design and device authentication
- Docker service isolation and exposure
- Linux system configuration
- Debugging connectivity and access issues
- Security-first design decisions

## Skills Demonstrated
- Linux system administration
- Networking fundamentals
- Docker & containerization
- Secure access & self-hosting
- Infrastructure design thinking
